# Introduction

The API reference documentation provides detailed information for each of the methods and endpoints of the platform.

The information can be used for reporting, reading collections, and accessing routes on the platform.

We have language bindings in NodeJs, C#, and Python! You can view code examples in the dark area to the right, and you can switch the programming language of the examples with the tabs in the top right.

# Getting Started

For application development please refer [developer guide](https://www.obto.co/site/ob/documentation).
